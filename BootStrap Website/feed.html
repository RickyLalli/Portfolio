        <p>
          <strong>
          The fundamental flaw that disqualifies most design portfolios we receive is the fact they don't present the problem that was solved and the decisions taken to reach the solution.
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal of this project was to work with a business, in this case MakerLabs, to find a friction points through the us of cultural probes and interviews. Upon discovering problems areas within the business, we were to come up with a solution. Throughout
          the project my main focus was filming, website interface development, research, and ideating cultural probes.

        <h3 class="h3">PROBLEM</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Our initial process in doing so involved the observation of the space, learning about the business workflow, and model. After which, we conducted interviews with both employees and users of the space to explore potential problems areas. In doing so, we
          noticed the business relied heavily on their website for providing information to both new and old customers. However, the content and layout were not intuitive and difficult to navigate due to important content being hidden behind various pages.
        </p>


        <h3 class="h3">PROCESS</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
          In order to learn more about the problem and possible ways in which we could solve it, we conducted interviews within each branch of the company. This included the CEO, Managers, Instructors, and the various independent makers within the space, and customers.
          Despite, everyone having much to say about the space, and what they like or dislike, we found a few common problems:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lack of signage</li>
          <li>Registering for a space/availability of space</li>
          <li>Density of information</li>
          <li>The massive amount of emails</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Before coming up with the solution, we started by using cultural probes to get feedback on what the key people in the company felt was a problem. In addition to the websites information heirarchy. Upon the deployment and completion of the probes. We found
          the biggest issue, and one which would help the business the most and touch on each aspect was the re-arranging of the information heirachy on the website through the development of a more UX friendly experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, we began looking at the websites information hierarchy and how to improve it. This process involved an analysis of both the current website and other websites belonging to competitors. In doing so we began interviewing employees one on one to get
          a stronger understanding of their needs and where friction points lied within the website and how this translated into the physical work environment. After doing so, we implemented cultural probes which were presented within a box to obtain
          more information through an abstract method. What we found was that the MakerLabs team wanted to invest more resources into the growth of the company, however, they spend a large portion of their time responding to emails and providing answer
          that already exist on the website. Through our research we found a direction in which to focus on when building the website for the company.

        <h2 class="h2">Humango Application</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to build out an app, focusing primarily on interaction design over development. We build an app, which was focused on bringing people together to go out and explore new cuisine. Therefore, the design was focused on visuals
          to help motivate and social interactions. The design process began with brainstorming ideas for building a food app. After coming up with a general list of ideas, we began looking at current apps in the market which involved food and looking
          at the target audience. After researching a variety of applications, we decided there was a market for users wanting to visit restaurants, particularly in Vancouver, but going alone is not enjoyable and planning with friends limits people for
          this exploration.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Therefore, we set out to create an application where strangers could meet and try new foods, which would help stimulate conversations and appeal to those who are considered &ldquo;foodies&rdquo;.
