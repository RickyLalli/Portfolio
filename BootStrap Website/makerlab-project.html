        <h2 class="h2">MakerLabs Website Overview</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>
          The fundamental flaw that disqualifies most design portfolios we receive is the fact they don't present the problem that was solved and the decisions taken to reach the solution.
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal of this project was to work with a business, in this case MakerLabs, to find a friction points through the us of cultural probes and interviews. Upon discovering problems areas within the business, we were to come up with a solution. Throughout
          the project my main focus was filming, website interface development, research, and ideating cultural probes.
        </p>

      <div class="container">

        <h3 class="h3">PROBLEM</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Our initial process in doing so involved the observation of the space, learning about the business workflow, and model. After which, we conducted interviews with both employees and users of the space to explore potential problems areas. In doing so, we
          noticed the business relied heavily on their website for providing information to both new and old customers. However, the content and layout were not intuitive and difficult to navigate due to important content being hidden behind various pages.
        </p>


        <h3 class="h3">PROCESS</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
          In order to learn more about the problem and possible ways in which we could solve it, we conducted interviews within each branch of the company. This included the CEO, Managers, Instructors, and the various independent makers within the space, and customers.
          Despite, everyone having much to say about the space, and what they like or dislike, we found a few common problems:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A lack of signage within the physical space</li>
          <li>Complexity of registration/availability of work space</li>
          <li>Online density of information</li>
          <li>Execssive amount of email due to system infrastrucutre</li>
        </ul>

        <img class="project-showcase-1 mx-auto d-block mb-3" src="assets/process-1/IMG_0081.JPG" alt="interview">

        <p>
          Before coming up with the solution, we started by using cultural probes to get feedback on what the key people in the company felt was a problem. In addition to the websites information heirarchy. Upon the deployment and completion of the probes. We found
          the biggest issue, and one which would help the business the most and touch on each aspect was the re-arranging of the information heirachy on the website through the development of a more UX friendly experience.
        </p>


        <h3 class="h3">SOLUTION</h3>

            <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/172799082" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>

        </div>

        <p>
          Thus, we began looking at the websites information hierarchy and how to improve it. This process involved an analysis of both the current website and other websites belonging to competitors. In doing so we began interviewing employees one on one to get
          a stronger understanding of their needs and where friction points lied within the website and how this translated into the physical work environment. After doing so, we implemented cultural probes which were presented within a box to obtain
          more information through an abstract method. What we found was that the MakerLabs team wanted to invest more resources into the growth of the company, however, they spend a large portion of their time responding to emails and providing answer
          that already exist on the website. Through our research we found a direction in which to focus on when building the website for the company.
