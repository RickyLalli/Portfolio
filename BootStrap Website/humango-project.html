        <h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:5rem;">OVERVIEW</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to build out an app, focusing primarily on interaction design over development. We build an app, which was focused on bringing people together to go out and explore new cuisine. Therefore, the design was focused on visuals
          to help motivate and social interactions. The design process began with brainstorming ideas for building a food app. After coming up with a general list of ideas, we began looking at current apps in the market which involved food and looking
          at the target audience. After researching a variety of applications, we decided there was a market for users wanting to visit restaurants, particularly in Vancouver, but going alone is not enjoyable and planning with friends limits people for
          this exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, we set out to create an application where strangers could meet and try new foods, which would help stimulate conversations and appeal to those who are considered &ldquo;foodies&rdquo;.
        </p>

              <h4>GOALS</h4>
                  <p>
                    Humango aims to connect like-minded individuals who are interested in experiencing food with others.
                    There is a stigma in Western culture that dictates that it's a negative to go out to eat alone. As a result we have created an application to allow users to enjoy the food they love without feeling isolated.
                    After all, good company enhances the experience of eating food, so why not get started today and explore the amazing food your city has to offer!

              <h4>DISCOVER NEW FOODS</h4>
                  <p>
                    The Discover feature introduces a new way of finding places to eat.
                    Often, you're are forced go through a tedious process of finding a restaurant before being able to see what dishes are being offered.

                    However, as people who also occasionally want to pick out a new place quickly, we think it is important to allow users to choose restaurants directly by the images they're interested in.

                    Our Discover feed lets you scroll through images of key dishes to find your favourite places to try next.

                    Once you're satisfied with choosing the right restaurant, you can join meetups that have been listed beneath the restaurant that you are are currently viewing.

                    Before joining, you are able to learn about the maximum group size, time, and date of the event.

                    Afterwards, you're placed within the group and have the opportunity as well to discuss any concerns or plans in the chat room prior to attending the meetup.

                    Alternatively, if you can't find an existing meetup at a preferred location, you are able to host your own.

                    Meetup creations are limited to within the next 7 days to help users stay connected, and to prevent plans from turning stale.

        <h4>Domain: Food</h4>

        <p>We started with the domain of food. Within this domain, we wanted to explore the ways in which people experience eating, or how they may go about choosing what food to eat.</p>
        <p>As a result, we started ideating by identifying step-by-step goals for a typical user. We created an experience map to help lay out the steps, moods, and frustrations an example user would go through while navigating our app.</p>

        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/process-2/experience-map.png" />

        <h3>Inspiration</h3>

        <p>After looking at various food application such as Yelp and Open Table. We realized that a majority of the food applications presumed people who were interested in food would prefer to eat alone, or had pre-existing company.</p>
        <p>However, through research we realized that often people prefer not to go out and eat if they cannot find someone to go along with them. As a result, we have introduced Humango, and application targeted towards foodies who would like to try various
          foods, without the hassle of finding friends to attend with.</p>

        <p>During our wireframing phase, our team also looked at these apps for inspiration and precendence, and drew out basic wireframes for these apps to try to identify the hierarchy and importance of their features, and to try to find any significant
          trends.

        <h3>Style guide & Platform</h3>

        <p>We chose our design platform to be iOS, which could take advantage of a primarily monochromatic color scheme and focus on flat design and a clean interface.</p>
        <p>Our use of the orange colour palette (center) stemmed from our desire to showcase the app with an adventurous and warm tone to get users in that mindset of discovering new food and meeting new people.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/process-2/styleguide.png" />
        </div>

        <h3>Sketches</h3>

        <p>We began the design with sketching out grey-box wireframes to layout the general architecture of our app and the menus, icons, and features we were thinking of implementing.</p>
        <p>Our team then tried to replicate this digitally and refine parts of the design over several iterations.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>User Research</h3>

        <p>Through user research we realized the need to simplify certain features, or completely redesign how the user interacts with them.</p>
        <p>Changing the way in which users were able to create and access their joined groups has clarified our overall design and has since created a simpler interface the user can understand.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Final Iterations</h3>

        <p>Over multiple stages of brainstorming, sketching, wireframing, and user testing, we refined Humango's interactions as well as its look and feel, improving upon the early mockups and grey-box wireframes that were used a foundation for our app development.</p>
        <p>Some of the before and after results are shown below, for our final iterations of<br>Humango's login, discover, and meetups pages.</p>
